Skipping most of these lectures since I already know Python.

## Sockets

* `socket` is a standard lib module that provides access to the BSD socket interface
* `s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)`
  * `socket.AF_INET`: IPv4
  * This is basically an IPv4 port
* `nc` (netcat) is a command line tool
